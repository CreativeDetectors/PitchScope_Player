PitchScope Player is a MP3 player which can also do realtime note detection while you listen. The newly detected notes are animated upon a colored circular display while your Windows Midi Synthesizer plays the detected notes along with the music. Player is designed to work on musical instrument solos, and is not really intended to detect the pitch of the human voice. 

PitchScope products were originally designed to help musicians figure out and write down the notes in a recording of a musical instrument's solo, such as a solo from a saxophone or an electric guitar. 

PitchScope Player is a type of music analysis software that is designed to detect the most dominant pitch (a musical note) at any given moment in time within a MP3 or WAV music file. Player is designed to work on musical instrument solos, and is not really intended to detect the pitch of a human voice. It can not detect multiple simultaneous notes, but will resort to just finding the loudest pitch at any given moment in time.

To have Player do note detection, all the user needs to do is load a MP3 file and push the Play Button. While the music plays, the Realtime Note Detector finds notes and plays them through Windows built-in midi synthesizer. Doing good note detection requires that the user carefully adjust the Note Detection Controls at the right. This is similar to how one might adjust the focus on a telescope to get the best possible image.

The C++ source code can be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio. PitchScope Player was designed and built by James Paul Millard (dba Creative Detectors of California).
