The Detail Slider is used to control the minimum length of the shortest notes during note detection. Like the Response Slider, this is also a VERY IMPORTANT control to adjust when trying to perform a good note detection. 
<BR>
<BR>


A <I>high</I> numeric setting upon this control will create too many short fragmented NoiseNotes, and a <I>low</I> setting will create very long notes and miss the shorter notes in the music. Users will want to experiment with this control during note detection to find the best setting that gives notes their proper length without creating too many short erroneous NoiseNotes.

The Detail Slider is a <I>very sensitive </I>control.  Whenever a new song is loaded it resets to its default position of 82. Most of the time you will only need to move it in the range of 66 to 90. Experiment with small moves and <I>wait several seconds </I>to evaluate the results.
