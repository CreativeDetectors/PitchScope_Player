When musicians listen to a musical recording and then write down its notes for sheet music, it is said that "they made a <I>transcription </I>of the song". 
<BR><BR>

While PitchScope products can NOT write down notes in the <I>notation style </I>of sheet music, they can transcribe the notes into a Notelist  as they spontaneously play the detected notes through Windows internal Midi Synthesizer.
<BR><BR>

As PitchScope Player transcribes the notes, it plays and displays them within the Revolver View's circular animation.
<BR><BR>
<BR>

Some PitchScope products, like <B>PitchScope Navigator </B>can also <I>create </I>and display the transcribed Notelists in a kind of Piano Roll Format upon a DrivingView animation. PitchScope Navigator can also save and reload the Notelists to hard drive, and can also <I>print </I>the transcribed Notelists to paper using a Piano Roll Format.
<BR><BR>
