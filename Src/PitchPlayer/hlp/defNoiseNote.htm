<BR><BR>
<BR>



Realtime automatic note detection attempts to find and identify all the notes of a musical instrument solo, as it spontaneously plays the detected notes through the Midi Synthesizer.
<BR><BR>

However note detection scans are not perfect, and if the Note Detection Controls are poorly adjusted the note detector will pick up erroneous notes from other instruments -- these incorrect notes are called 'NoiseNotes'. By properly adjusting the Response Slider and Detail Slider controls, noisenotes can be greatly reduced.
<BR><BR>

See the <I>Detecting Notes While Playing a Song - Tutorial </I>for a better discussion on the proper use of the Response Slider and Detail Slider controls.
