Move this slider control upward to increase the <I>sensitivity </I>of the Note Detector. This is the MOST IMPORTANT control to adjust when trying to perform a good note detection.

<BR>

The Response Slider can be used to eliminate notes with a <I>poor detection value </I>(NoiseNotes), or to increase the amount of total notes detected. A very low setting will eliminate too many valid notes, and a very high setting will not eliminate enough weak erroneous (noise) notes. Users will want to experiment with this control during note detection to find the best setting that includes the important valid notes, while only allowing a small amount of NoiseNotes. Adjusting this control is like focusing the lens on a telescope, as you attempt to get the best possible image.

The Response Slider is a very sensitive control. Whenever a new song is loaded it resets to its default position of 70. Most of the time you will only need to move it in the range of 60 to 80. Experiment with small moves and <I>wait several seconds </I>to evaluate the results.

Make sure to read and perform the tutorial called <I>Detecting Notes While Playing a Song - Tutorial</I>.
