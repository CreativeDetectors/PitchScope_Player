<B>About PitchScope Player</B>
<BR>
<BR>

PitchScope Player is a shareware application designed to demonstrate some of the pitch-detecting and musical transcription capabilities of our flagship products, PitchScope Navigator and PitchScope 2.0. 
<BR><BR>

PitchScope products were originally designed to help musicians figure out and write down the notes in a recording of a musical instrument's solo, such as a solo from a saxophone or an electric guitar. PitchScope Player is a type of music analysis software that is designed to detect the most dominant pitch (a musical note) at any given moment in time within a MP3 or Wave(.wav) music file. Player is designed to work on musical instrument solos, and is not really intended to detect the pitch of a human voice. It can not detect multiple simultaneous notes, but will resort to just finding the loudest pitch at any given moment in time. 
<BR><BR>

Pitch detection upon <I>polyphonic recordings </I>(multiple instruments playing at once) has long been a major puzzle for audio research scientists. While this detection problem has not been fully solved, PitchScope products can make accurate note detections in many circumstances. Harmonically dense instruments like electric guitars, saxophones, blues harmonicas, clarinets, etc. will detect better with PitchScope Player than harmonically sparse instruments, such as a flute or piano.
<BR><BR>

Player is a type of educational software and is simple enough for children over 6 years, if an adult or older child will read this document and help the child get familiar the program's commands. The software does NOT require a child to know how to read music, or even how to play a musical instrument. As such, PitchScope Player can be used as a discovery tool that introduces a child or older student to some of the building blocks of music -- almost like a microscope with which to observe the notes of an instrumental solo.
