<B>PitchScope Navigator</B> is a full-featured automatic transcription application which can also <I>create </I>or record Notelist Files from realtime note-detection sessions.    
<BR><BR>


Notelist Files can be saved and reloaded from hard drive, and can also be modified in a graphic editor, printed out, and played at various speeds via Windows built-in Midi Synthesizer, or through an <I>external </I>Midi Device or Synthesizer. 
<BR><BR>

Navigator can also detect notes at different Slowed-Down Speeds, which play the music more slowly while maintaining the instrument's original pitch. Because the Slowed-Down Speeds allow Navigator to make more measurements within the music, note detections at Slowed-Down Speeds are much more accurate than detections done at the normal speed ("1") which is used by PitchScope Player. Slowed-Down Speeds can also help the user gradually learn how to finger the notes of a solo as they play along upon their instrument. 
<BR><BR>


Navigator also has enhanced animation displays like the DrivingView, which can show upcoming notes in a variety of graphically animated styles (see diagram below).
