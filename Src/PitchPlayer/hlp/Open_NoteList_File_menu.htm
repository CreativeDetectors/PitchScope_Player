<B>Open NoteList File  -  Menu Command</B>
<BR>
<BR>


Use this menu command to load  PitchScope Notelist files, which end with the extension <I>.pnl</I>.  

<BR>
<BR>

Notelist files can only be <I>created </I>with a PitchScope application, like PitchScope Navigator. Applications like PitchScope Navigator can <I>save </I>the  spontaneously detected notes to a Notelist file which can later be reloaded, or shared with other users on the Internet.

After a Notelist has been loaded, the user then has a choice to hear the MidiNotes from either that Notelist, or spontaneously from the Note Detector. This choice is accomplished by the setting on the MIDI SOURCE radio buttons. Selecting NOTELIST will cause the MidiNotes to come from the Notelist, and selecting DETECTION will cause the notes to come from spontaneous note detection.

Since PitchScope Player is a <I>shareware</I> application, Navigator users who wish to distribute their Notelist transcription files upon the Internet can legally distribute PitchScope Player as a <I>listening device </I>for those Notelists, as long as they abide by abide by the License Agreement ("EULA") for PitchScope Player and the rules for shareware distribution.
