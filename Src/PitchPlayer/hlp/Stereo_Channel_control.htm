If it seems that the instrument you wish to detect is dominant in either the left or right stereo channel, slide this control to increase the Note Detector's <I>focus </I>upon that particular channel. If there is an imbalance in the mix, as the slider is moved about you should at some point hear the instrument the most clearly -- that is your best setting.

However since most recordings balance the solo instruments in the center, you should not have to use this control very often.

This control is ONLY for fine-tuning the FOCUS of your note DETECTION -- do NOT use this control strictly for <I>audio</I> as you would on a typical music player's Stereo Balance control.
