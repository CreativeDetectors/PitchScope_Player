This control determines from which <I>source </I>you will hear the Midi Synthesizer's notes. If no NoteList has been loaded from file, then the selected radio button will always be <I>Detection</I>. However if you loaded a PitchScope NoteList file to Player, you will then have a choice to hear the midi notes from either that NoteList, or spontaneously from the Note Detector. 
<BR><BR>
If you have selected the <I>NoteList</I> radio button, then the Note Detection Controls will have no effect upon the notes that you hear.

Also read  about  the <I>Open NoteList File </I>menu command.
