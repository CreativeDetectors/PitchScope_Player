<B>Notelist - Definition</B>
<BR><BR>
<BR>



The main purpose of PitchScope products is to detect the notes within an instrumental solo, and then group those notes into a Notelist which can be played through a Midi Synthesizer .
<BR><BR>

Notelist Files can be saved, reloaded...  also be edited and printed with some PitchScope products like <B>PitchScope Navigator</B>.
<BR><BR>

Since PitchScope Player is a <I>shareware</I> application, Navigator users who wish to distribute their NoteList transcription files upon the Internet can legally distribute PitchScope Player as a listening device for those NoteLists, as long as they abide by the laws for shareware distribution.
