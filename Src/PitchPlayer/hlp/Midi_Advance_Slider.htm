Dependent on the speed of your computer and the speed of Midi Devices, you may hear that the Recording and the MidiNotes are slightly out of <I>synchronization</I>.
<BR>
<BR>


This control can be toggled to adjust the <I>synchronization </I>of the MidiNotes relative to the play of the Recording.  Increasing the value on this control will cause the MidiNotes to be played <I>earlier </I>in time than the musical recording.

<BR>
<BR>

Two different settings for the Midi Advance are actually saved: one for when the Midi Source buttons are set for DETECTION, and a different setting is saved when the Midi Source is set for NOTELIST. If you have a NoteList loaded, you can observe the two different settings by toggling the Midi Source radio buttons. The two different settings are NOT supposed to have the same value, but are specific to each Midi Source mode.
